# esx_eden_garage
Vehicle Garage based on ESX

I did NOT create the Code. I only edited the code to create this.

This Garage Script only takes into account the Vehicles Purchased in the Car Shop. Players can also go to the Car Pound to retrieve their Vehicle if its lost or Destroyed for a Fee. During a reboot all Vehicles go back home. 

Works with the New Plate System & New Update allows use of Property Garages

# Requirement:

* Vehicle Shop
  * [esx_vehicleshop](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_vehicleshop)

# Installation

1) CD in your resources/[esx] folder
2) Clone the repository
3) Import `eden_garage.sql` in your database
4) Add this in your `server.cfg`:
